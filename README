The m17n library is a multilingual text processing library for the C
language.


(1) INSTALLATION

(1-1) From CVS working directory.

Run the script "bootstrap.sh" in this directory.  It is tested that
the script run successfully with these versions of autotools.

	libtool-1.5.6
	automake-1.9.5
	autoconf-2.59

Then, proceed to the next step.

(1-2) From the tarball.

The m17n library utilizes these extra libraries.  It is recommended to
install all of them before running the "configure" script.  The script
will find out the existence of them automatically.

	libxml2		-- http://xmlsoft.org/
	fribidi	  	-- http://fribidi.sourceforge.net/
	freetype	-- http://www.freetype.org/
	libotf		-- http://www.m17n.org/libotf/
	fontconfig	-- http://freedesktop.org/Software/fontconfig
	xft		-- http://freedesktop.org/Software/Xft
	gd		-- http://www.boutell.com/gd/http/gd-1.8.4.tar.gz

In addition, for finding a word boundary in Thai text, "configure"
checks the existence of these libraries (libthai is preferred):

	libthai		-- http://
	wordcut		-- http://thaiwordseg.sourceforge.net/

The sample program m17n-edit utilizes this Japanese inputting system.
It is also recommended to install it.

	anthy		-- http://anthy.sourceforge.jp/

Then, type the followings on the command line.

	% ./configure
	% make
	% make install

Note that this package assumes an ANSI C compiler such as gcc.  It
will not compile with an old-style K&R compiler.

The default installation path is "/usr/local".
Thus, these header files are installed in /usr/local/include:
	m17n-core.h, m17n.h, m17n-gui.h, m17n-err.h, m17n-X.h
These library files are installed in /usr/local/lib:
	libm17n-core.{a,so*,la}
	libm17n.{a,so*,la}
	libm17n-gui.{a,so*,la}
	libm17n-X.{a,so*,la}
	libm17n-gd.{a,so*,la}
	libimx-anthy.{a,so*,la},
	libimx-ispell.{a,so*,la},
This shell script is installed in /usr/local/bin:
	m17n-config
These sample programs are installed in /usr/local/bin too:
	m17n-conv, m17n-date, m17n-view, m17n-dump, m17n-edit

If you don't need GUI libraries (libm17n-gui.so and etc.), you can
instruct the `configure' script not to build them as below:

	% ./configure --without-gui

This file under `example' sub-directory is a Japanese resource file
for m17n-edit.  It is not installed but useful in Japanese locale.  Copy
it to your home directory (or, for instance,
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/ja/app-defaults) and rename it to "M17NEdit" if you
want to see labels in Japanese:
	M17NEdit.ja

These text files under `example' sub-directory are not installed but
useful for testing the rendering engine of the m17n library:
	HELLO.utf8 HELLO.xml HELLO-ja.utf8 HELLO-ja.xml HELLO.html
XXX.xml are generated from XXX.utf8 by attaching text property
`language' and serializing.

Please read also INSTALL for the generic installation instructions.


(2) DATABASE

The m17n library utilizes the m17n database available at:
	http://www.m17n.org/m17n-lib/m17n-db
Without this database, the m17n library loses half its value.  Please
install it (Ver.1.3.0 or the later is required) too before you try the
above sample programs or develop a program that uses the m17n library.


(3) DOCUMENTATION

This page has a link to full documentation of the m17n library:
	http://www.m17n.org/m17n-lib

Actually, the documentation was generated by Doxygen using comments in
the source files.  There are English and Japanese comments in
parallel.


(4) USAGE

The library provides three levels of APIs, CORE, SHELL, and GUI.  For
CORE API, include <m17n-core.h>, for SHELL API, include <m17n.h>, and
for GUI API, include <m17n-gui.h >.  See the documentation above, or
the manual of m17nIntro(3) for more detail.

The shell script "m17n-config" helps compiling and linking of a
program that uses the m17n library.  For instance this compiles PROG.c
that uses SHELL API and builds executable PROG.

	% gcc -o PROG `m17n-config --cflags` `m17n-config --libs` PROG.c

This compiles PROX.c that uses GUI API and builds executable PROX.

	% gcc -o PROX `m17n-config GUI --cflags` `m17n-config GUI --libs` PROX.c
