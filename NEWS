* Changes in the m17n library 1.3.0

** New fucntions mtext_insert () and and mtext_replace () for
modifying M-text.

** New functions mtext_uppercase (), mtext_titlecase (),
mtext_lowercase () implement "3.13 Default Case Operations" of The
Unicode Standard 4.0.

** New function mtext_line_break () implements the line breaking
algorithm of The Unicode Standard 4.0 UAX#14.


* Changes in the m17n library 1.2.0

** Two new variables MTEXT_FORMAT_UTF_16 and MTEXT_FORMAT_UTF_32.
They are initialized to one of MTEXT_FORMAT_UTF_16LE,
MTEXT_FORMAT_UTF_16BE,  MTEXT_FORMAT_UTF_LE,  MTEXT_FORMAT_UTF_32BE
dependending on the systems's endianess.

** In the argument PLIST of mframe (), the key Mfont can be used to
specify which font-backend to use.  The value must be Mx or Mfreetype.

** New function mfont_list () returns a list of matching fonts.

** New function m17n_status () returns the current initialization
status.

** New function minput_reset () resets the current input context.

** Names of sample programs have prefix "m17n-" instead of single "m".
This is to avoid confiliction of program names included in the other
packages.


* Changes in the m17n library 1.1.0

** The "configure" script now detects Fontconfig, Xft2, and GD
libraries.

If Fontconfig library is found, the library find local font files
(that are to be handled by the Freetype library) by fontconfig, and if
Xft2 library is also found, draw text by Xft.

** Mdevice (new symbol) is recoginized as a key in the argument PLIST
of mframe ().

The value must be Mx (new symbol), Mgd (new symbol), or Mnil.  See the
documentation of mframe () for more detail.

** MDrawControl has a new member `anti_alias'.

If MDrawControl->anti_alias is nonzero, try to draw anti-aliased text
if local fonts are used for that text via Freetype.  If Xft2 library
can be used, the anti-alias processing is done by Xft2's drawing
routine.  Otherwise, the m17n library itself does it by assumming that
the background color is `background' property of a face.

** Modification of face is now automatically refelected to the next
drawing.

So, for instance, an application can change the default face of a
frame after the frame is created.  The sample program "medit" utilize
it now.

** New function mfontset_lookup () reports contents of a fontset.

** New function mplist_deseriaze () parses an M-Text and generates a
plist.

** The functions mfont_name () and mfont_from_name () are now obsolete
(still kept for backward compatibility).  Use mfont_parse_name () and
mfont_unparse_name () instead.

** The sample program "mdump" generates PNG image file instead of PBM.

It now runs only when the m17n library is configured with the Freetype
library and the GD library.


* Changes in the m17n library 1.0

** Released.
