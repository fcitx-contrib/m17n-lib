* Changes in the m17n library 1.1

** The "configure" script now detects Xft2 library.

If Xft2 library is found, find local font files (that are to be
handled by the Freetype library) by fontconfig, and draw text by Xft.

** MDrawControl has a new member `anti_alias'.

If MDrawControl->anti_alias is nonzero, try to draw anti-aliased text.
This is done only when a local font file is used for drawing.



* Changes in the m17n library 1.0

** Released.
