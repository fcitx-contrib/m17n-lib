@section synopsis SYNOPSIS

m17n-config [CORE | GUI] [--cflags | --libs | --libtool] [--version]

@section description DESCRIPTION

The shell script m17n-config prints compile and link options for a
program that uses the m17n library.

By default, the printed options are for such a program that uses SHELL
API of the libray.  But, if the first argument is "CORE", the options
are for a program that uses only CORE API, if the first argument "GUI",
the options are for a program that uses GUI API.

The other arguments are as follows.

- --cflags\n
	Print compile option (e.g. -I/usr/local/include)
- --libs\n
	Print link option (e.g. -L/usr/local/lib -lm17n)
- --libtool\n
	Print libtool option (e.g. /usr/local/lib/libm17n.la)
- --version\n
	Print version number of the m17n library.
